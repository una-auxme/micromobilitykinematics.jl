In conclusion, the L-component was initially modelled by calculating the most significant points within its reference coordinate system. Given the dynamic properties of the wheel suspension and the uncertainty surrounding the influence of subsequent dimensioning on the L-BKS, an independent coordinate system was defined. This Q-BKS enables the tracing of both the position of the L-BKS and the movement of the control arms. In order to calculate the missing joint in an efficient manner, the D-BKS was defined. This involved calculating the centre of rotation of the steering lever and then transforming it into the independent coordinate system. The objective is to combine the two systems, namely the L-BKS and the D-BKS, into a coherent kinematic system with the aim of determining the joint position.","category":"page"},{"location":"kinematic/","page":"Kinematic of the steering geometry","title":"Kinematic of the steering geometry","text":"A comprehensive examination of the kinematic system reveals the existence of two additional components whose influence has not yet been incorporated into the existing calculations. Firstly, the rotation of the track lever, whose centre point has been determined thus far, and secondly, the tie rod, which connects both systems and translates the movement of the L-component to the wheel. In the absence of a connection to the track lever, the tie rod is capable of moving freely around the centre of the joint on the L-component, thereby forming a sphere of potential alignments. If the circular path of the track lever intersects the sphere of the tie rod, this describes the exact position of the joint on the track lever. The maximum number of intersection points that can be determined is limited to two possible positions of the joint, one of which must be selected.

If either the radius of the drawbar sphere coloured in purple or the circular path of the steering lever are too short, an interaction of both movements is precluded. The same applies if the drawbar or the steering lever are oversized so that the circular path of the steering lever is enclosed by the drawbar sphere, or if the opposite situation arises.

To elucidate this phenomenon, a visual illustration is provided in Figure 3.14. Let us assume that the dimensions of the steering lever (l) are significantly longer than the radius of the z-rotation (r_z) of the L-component. A stepwise rotation around the origin of the vector rz with the steering angle θz results in a displacement of the positions along their circular paths, which are represented by the green and orange lines in Figure 3.14. If the direction of rotation of the vector r_z is clockwise, an identical rotation of the vector l would be expected due to the kinematic dependency. However, if the angle of rotation is exceeded, the steering lever l moves in the opposite direction to that of the original rotation. The direction of movement is divided into two phases, with the start, turning and end points shown more intensively in their respective colours and their direction of movement illustrated by arrows.

In the event that a setting exceeds the aforementioned singularity, it is evident that the dimensioning is not suitable.
